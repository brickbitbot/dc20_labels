One underutilized, and amazing, thing about the docker image scheme is labels. Labels are a built in way to document all aspects about the image itself. Think about all the information that the tags inside your clothing carry. If you care to look you can find out everything about the garment. All that information can be very valuable. Now think about how we can leverage labels to carry similar information. We can even use the labels to contain Docker Compose or even Kubernetes Yaml. We can even include labels into the CI/CD process making things more secure and smoother. Come find out some fun techniques on how to leverage labels to do some fun and amazing things.
